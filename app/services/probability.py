Probability calculation service for individual golf scoring.

This module implements the core probability calculations for individual golfers,
including course handicap computation, expected score calculation, scoring
distribution modeling, and multi-round probability calculations.

All calculations use conservative assumptions to avoid overstating the odds
of exceptional rounds.
